## Motivation

**ThotVim: The Divine and Questionable Journey**

Thot‚Äî**Egyptian god of wisdom and knowledge**‚Äîis the perfect namesake for this setup. Why? Because the sheer amount of **research, trial, and tribulation** it took to create this **quick and dirty** Neovim configuration rivals the construction of the pyramids. üèóÔ∏èThough, they had great "alien" tech, I on the other hand had only my old dusty laptop.

For **five long years**, I stuck to my trusty **init.vim**, a simple yet effective setup that never betrayed me. Then, one fateful day, I thought:  
*"What if I modernize it? What if I optimize it? What if... I actually try?"*

And thus began my **downward spiral into Lua, plugins, and broken configs**. Countless hours, hundreds of Stack Overflow visits, and at least **three existential crises later**, I present to you: **ThotVim**‚Äîa **lightweight, no-strings-attached** Neovim configuration that launches faster than your last relationship ended. üíîüî•

It‚Äôs **basic**, it‚Äôs **fast**, and it‚Äôs **probably all you‚Äôll ever need**‚Äîuntil you get tempted by another Vim plugin and start the cycle all over again. üöÄ

### How is it Different?

1. It doesn't tries to do _Everything_
2. It's not a distro, not an operating system. Plain, simple and sane Code Editor.
3. It works with less efforts and more efficiency.

## Requirements

External Requirements:

- Basic utils:¬†`git`,¬†`make`,¬†`unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on the platform)
- A¬†[Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set¬†`vim.g.have_nerd_font`¬†in¬†`init.lua`¬†to true
- Emoji fonts (Ubuntu only, and only if you want emoji!)¬†`sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you need¬†`npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need¬†`go`
  - etc.

## Installation

1. Simply clone the repo in `~/.config/nvim` and Start Neovim the minimum required version is 0.8+,
   However, Best Experience is available on 0.10+ (As its tested by me.)

2. If you simply want to try it out:
   
   ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/Aeres-u99/ThotVim.git ~/.config/testsetup
       # This should start neovim and fetch all of the required plugins
       NVIM_APPNAME=testsetup nvim
       # Cleanup
       ls -altrh ~/.local/share/testsetup
       rm -rf ~/.local/share/testsetup
   ```

## ToDo

1. Zen Mode

2. Highlight only the segment I am editing and blur out the rest of code base

3. Mini Buffer + Function Preview

4. Better REPL Support

5. **Find a Magical Potion** ‚Äì Ideally one that **instantly fixes all my bugs** and **writes perfect code** for me. Or at least something that makes debugging less soul-crushing. üç∑‚ú®
